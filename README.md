Telecom Growth Strategies Through Customer Lifetime Value Segmentation

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and segmenting customers based on their Lifetime Value (CLV) to devise effective growth strategies for a telecom company. By utilizing PostgreSQL for data management and analysis, we aim to provide actionable insights that drive customer retention and maximize revenue.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a key metric that helps businesses understand the total value a customer brings over their entire relationship with the company. By segmenting customers based on CLV, telecom companies can create targeted strategies to retain high-value customers, reduce churn, and enhance overall profitability.
